# UI/UX Assignments

This folder contains all UI/UX design and development assignments for the Summer Programming Class.

## Structure

Each assignment should be placed in its own subdirectory with a descriptive name.

Example:
```
UI-UX/
├── Assignment1-Wireframes/
├── Assignment2-Prototyping/

```

## Guidelines

- Include all relevant files (designs, prototypes, documentation)
- Add a README.md in each assignment folder describing the task and approach
- Include screenshots or links to interactive prototypes when applicable
