# Java Assignments

This folder contains all Java programming assignments for the Summer Programming Class.

## Structure

Each assignment should be placed in its own subdirectory with a descriptive name.

Example:
```
Java/
├── Assignment1-OOP/
├── Assignment2-Collections/
└── Assignment3-Multithreading/
```

## Guidelines

- Include all source code files (.java)
- Add a README.md in each assignment folder describing the task and implementation
- Include any necessary build files (pom.xml, build.gradle, etc.)
- Document dependencies and how to compile/run the project
